# Link Shortener

A very basic link shortener using the Bitly API.

1. Clone from GitHub
2. `cd` into directory
3. Run `npm start`

## Notes

Link to the Bitly docs: https://dev.bitly.com/

It's written in JavaScript, but this is not ideal. It should be typed (TypeScript). For example, the component state (i.e. 'typing'/'error'/'success') could utilize a union type.

## Tests Inlcude:

- UI elements and user interactions
- "Happy path", mocking fetch
